Dear[ARAVIND S],

I hope this message finds you well. We are excited about your participation in our upcoming project focusing on creating a Docker-based Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. Below, you will find the details of the assignment, along with the submission guidelines.

Project Overview:
You are tasked with developing a Dockerized Web Application Vulnerability Lab. This will be a simple web application containing intentional vulnerabilities. The objective is to create a series of challenges where participants exploit these vulnerabilities to find hidden flags, scoring points for each flag discovered.
